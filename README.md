## Project Overview
This repository contains the **Applied Data Science Capstone Project** as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.  
The goal is to apply data science skills—data cleaning, visualization, analysis, and machine learning—to a real-world dataset.

---

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze  SpaceX launch data,
Build dashboards for insights,
Predict whether the first stage will be reused using machine learning.
and generate actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.  
- Visualize trends, patterns, and correlations.  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models.  
- Provide recommendations based on insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, IBM Watson Studio  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Dataset downloaded from [SpaceX REST API].  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and summary statistics.  
4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones.  
5. **Modeling:** Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Clustering.  
6. **Evaluation:** Metrics such as Confusion matrix, accuracy, RMSE, F1-score, etc.  
7. **Deployment (Optional):** Model deployed using IBM Cloud or similar platforms.
